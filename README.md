## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Animation**: Leverages Google Generative AI for intelligent text analysis and animation cue extraction
- 🎭 **Automatic Lip Sync**: Generates phoneme data to synchronize character mouth movements with dialogue
- 👁️ **Dynamic Character Expressions**: Supports head movements, eye expressions, and body language
- 🎨 **Multi-Character Support**: Handle multiple characters with distinct visual assets and personalities
- 🎵 **Audio Synchronization**: Perfectly aligns animation with audio timing using transcription services
- 🖼️ **Extensible Asset System**: Easy-to-use character and background asset management
- 📹 **Frame-by-Frame Generation**: Creates smooth animations by compositing individual frames
- 🔄 **Automated Workflow**: Complete pipeline from script to final video

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Docker (for audio transcription service)
- Google API Key (for AI text analysis)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Automate-Animation/synctoon.git
   cd synctoon
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the transcription service:**
   ```bash
   cd Docker
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Configure your API key:**
   - Open `core/core.py`
   - Replace `GOOGLE_API_KEY = "..."` with your actual Google API key

### Create Your First Animation

1. **Prepare your story files** (or use the provided examples):
   - Text script: `example/story/your_story.txt`
   - Audio file: `example/story/your_story.mp3`

2. **Generate the animation:**
   ```bash
   cd core
   python create_animation.py -n "my_first_animation"
   ```

3. **Combine video with audio** (final step):
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i videos/my_first_animation.mp4 -i ../example/story/your_story.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac final_animation.mp4
   ```

## 🎯 Vision & Mission

**Our goal is to democratize animation creation.** We believe everyone should have access to powerful animation tools regardless of their technical background or budget. Synctoon is completely free and open-source, empowering storytellers, educators, content creators, and hobbyists to bring their ideas to life.

## 🎨 Character Customization

Synctoon supports extensive character customization:

1. **Add new characters** in `core/images/characters/character_X/`
2. **Organize assets** into folders: `body/`, `eyes/`, `head/`, `mouth/`, `background/`
3. **Configure positioning** in `metadata/metadata.json`
4. **Support for emotions** and expressions through asset variations

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

We're actively working on exciting new features:

- 🖼️ **Dynamic Background Elements**: Add contextual images, doodles, and visual elements that enhance storytelling
- 🌄 **Real-time Background Generation**: AI-powered background creation that adapts to story context
- 🎭 **Enhanced Character Library**: Expanded collection of characters, emotions, and animations
- 🎨 **Visual Effects System**: Particle effects, transitions, and cinematic elements
- 📱 **Web Interface**: Browser-based animation creation tool
- 🌍 **Multi-language Support**: International language and voice support
- 🤝 **Community Asset Marketplace**: Share and discover character assets and backgrounds
